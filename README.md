# GPU in Google Colab
Do NOT ever switch the runtime to GPU runtime if you have no use of GPU at all!<br>
Switching to GPU runtime won't give you more storage space and in fact, Google reduces the storage space when you connect to GPU runtime.<br>
Not only that, Google can (and of course, obviously, have the full righh to) ban you from using the GPU in Google Colab.<br>
(my account can't no longer connect to GPU runtime but I don't care about that as I don't need to use the GPU, so that's a real thing)
